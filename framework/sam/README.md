# Sam

This module enables the APIs and creates the service accounts needed to run the
[Sam service](https://github.com/broadinstitute/sam/).

It does not create the persistent storage resources that Sam relies on. See
[Sam Persistence](../sam-persistence/README.md).

## TODO
Need to add manual steps for GSuite service accounts. See terraform-terra repo.
