# terra-cluster deployment
This Terraform deployment definition manages Terra Framework clusters and cluster-level infrastructure configuration, such as the networks/NATs.
This configuration is namespaced by cluster with TF workspaces & Atlantis project definitions for each different Terra cluster it manages.
For more information and until this README is expanded, check out the [framework deployment doc](https://docs.dsp-devops.broadinstitute.org/framework-kernel-new-stack/framework-deployment).
